# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

After you finish this Ruby on Rails Tutorial, find more great tutorials and challenges, check out [*Railsbrige*](http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/)!

In case you haven't noticed, I'm quite new at this, so if you have some constructive criticism, have at it. If it doesn't pass the Rule of 3, there are plenty of other places to vent online :D.
